1. Authorization & Role-Based Access Control
   Implement Admin/User roles properly.
   Ensure Admin can create, edit, and delete travel plans.
   Users should only be able to view and register/deregister from plans.

2. UI Enhancements
   Admin Dashboard: Manage travel plans (CRUD).
   User Dashboard: Browse upcoming plans, register, view registered plans, and exit.
   Form Validations: Prevent duplicate registrations, validate dates.

3. Registration Constraints
   Users should be blocked from deregistering after the deadline.
   Ensure double registrations are prevented.

4. Exception Handling & Logging
   Implement global exception handling for API errors.
   Add logging (e.g., using SLF4J) for tracking requests and issues.
5. API Rate Limiting & Security Enhancements
   Prevent spam registrations using rate-limiting (e.g., Bucket4j).
   Secure endpoints using JWT tokens & role validation.
   Use CORS policies for frontend-backend communication.
6. Deployment & Monitoring
   Dockerize backend & frontend apps.
   Use Kubernetes Helm charts for deployment.
   Set up logging & monitoring (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus).
